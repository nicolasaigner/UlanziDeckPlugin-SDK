 To enhance creators' productivity and meet diverse needs, the U-Studio team has initiated the UlanziDeck project. We believe that creators are not only consumers but also producers. Through co-creation and content sharing, a win-win situation can be achieved. We have launched the UlanziDeck plugin development plan and have successfully developed many feature-rich plugins through close cooperation with numerous developers. To further facilitate and incentivize developers, we have decided to create an open-source repository, inviting all developers to participate and jointly build a more open, flexible, and powerful plugin platform.



## I. Plugin Component Library

**The open-source library for plugin development is primarily focused on simple and easy-to-use protocol calls, event distribution, and secure and stable network connections. It provides developers with a set of common tools, interfaces, and specifications to lower the barrier to plugin development. The development scope includes but is not limited to protocol encapsulation, common components, custom pop-up components, and more.**
